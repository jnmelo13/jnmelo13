## Hello, I'm Juan Melo

**AI Engineer | GenAI & MCP | Software Engineering & Cloud**

I work on production-grade AI systems with strong foundations in software engineering, clean architecture, and cloud infrastructure. My work spans LLM applications, multi-agent orchestration, observability-first design, and governed tool integrations using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

### 🔍 Key Highlights

- Building MCP servers that integrate enterprise systems with copilots using OAuth 2.1, OpenTelemetry, structured logs, and cloud-native APIs.  
- Experience with modern agentic AI frameworks, including LangGraph, OpenAI Agents SDK, and LangSmith for tracing and evaluation, implementing guardrails through schema validation, controlled tool execution, and robust I/O constraints
- Developed agentic workflows, multi-step reasoning systems, and tool-enabled AI pipelines using both LLMs and SLMs depending on cost/performance needs.  
- Hands-on experience with RAG, embeddings, vector search, and full-stack AI pipelines deployed on Cloud Run.  
- Built traditional ML systems (forecasting, predictive modeling, clustering, geospatial ML) supported by MLOps pipelines for data drift detection, continuous training, automated deployment, and cloud-native monitoring.
